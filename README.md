# Water-billing-system
This project will help facilitate the accurate calculation, generation and management of water utility bills of residents of a particular area. It will help them get their accurate bills and the amount of money to pay according to the water units used.
The problem trying to be addressed is that people landlords, caretakers and house agents tend to take advantage of the fact that they are the only ones able to read the water bills so they dont tell the tenants the amount of water consumed nor the price per unit, they just charge them which adds up to alot of money.
Customer information management where customer details will be stored and managed, meter reading recording where readings for each customer will be recorded, usage analysis and reports where customers will be able to track their usage, consuption calculation where the previous and prent readings will be gauged.
Risks: users may resist introduction of a new system since they are used to one method, since the market is competitive, other people may try to sabotage the project, implementation costs which may be high making the projet take long to be implemented, internet access and reliability where the system relies on internet so incase of poor connectivity it may be hard for the customers to access.
